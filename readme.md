# Script to check length of literals

Run this script is to compare the length of literals against a maximum
set manually in a separate file

## Getting started

1. The .csv file should contain the first column as the literal path and
the second column as the maximum number of characters.
2. Add the Yaml files you want to check inside the 'literals' folder
3. In order to run:
  - ```$ ruby main.rb literals```
  - The literals argument is the name of the folder you want to check.

Then we can add the literals files (.yml) in the 'literals' folders.
